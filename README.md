# Keto Archives

The internet is a wonderful place, full of amazing resources and a great deal of content generated by the good people of the world.

Unfortunately, recipes keep getting deleted, so I have decided to start archiving recipes and other resources that I find relevant.

All credit will be given to the original authors; the URLs to each resource archived will be provided, as well as whatever author information I can ascertain.

If you wish to have an article removed, please contact me and I will remove it from the archive.
