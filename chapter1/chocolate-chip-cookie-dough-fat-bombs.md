## Recipe:

* 8 oz cream cheese softened

* 1 stick \(1/2 cup\) salted butter

* 1/2 cup creamy peanut butter

* 1/3 cup swerve sweetener \(erythritol\)

* 1 tsp vanilla extract

* 4 oz Lillyâ€™s baking chips \(stevia sweetened chocolate chips\)

Mix \(cream\) together all ingredients. Refrigerate dough for 30 minutes. Portion into teaspoon size balls and spoon onto a parchment lined baking sheet OR roll into a log in parchment paper like a regular tube of cookie dough. Freeze for another 30 minutes, then \(if you did the log approach\) cut into slices like a regular tube of cookie dough. Once frozen / portioned, store in a tupperware or ziploc in the freezer.
